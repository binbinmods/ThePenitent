    "CharacterDescription": "Worship. Worship means something different to each and every person. For Cain, it is not an act of devotion or reverence but a path to power forged in agony. Once, he was a man bound by loyalty and love, but those bonds were shattered in the most intimate of betrayals—by his own brother. In the depths of desperation, Cain's heart was consumed by a darkness more insidious than any external enemy. He betrayed the one person who had once been his closest kin, sacrificing him to the very powers he now worships. It was through this heinous act that Cain's soul was marked, his heart blackened, and his mind corrupted. His faith, twisted and unyielding, is now rooted in the belief that betrayal is the truest path to power, and that through the suffering of others—through his own unrepentant sin—he is slowly becoming the instrument of that very dark will.",
